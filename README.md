# Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and we challenge participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources. For the challenge, we designed a utility function that rewards early predictions and penalizes late predictions as well as false alarms.
